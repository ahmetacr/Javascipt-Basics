    "Important Note: "
    <!-- 
        Your JS, for the most part, is run whenever the JS file is run, or when the
        script tag is encountered in the HTML, if you are including your JS at the top
        of your file, many of these DOM manipulation methods will not work because the 
        JS code is being run before the nodes are created in the DOM. The simplest way
        to fix this is to include your JS at the bottom of your HTML file so that it 
        gets run after the DOM nodes are parsed and created.

        Alternatively, you can link the JS file in the <head> of your HTML document.
        Use the <script> tag with the src attribute containing the path to the JS file,
        and include the 'defer' keyword to load the file after the HTML is parsed, 
        such as  what we did above!
