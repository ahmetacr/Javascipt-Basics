In this Project, We are going to working on Functions of Javascript.

We went through various different examples of function usage in JavaScript. 
We learned the ones with variables, non-variables, and even functions without names!
There is also a new type of function syntax called arrow functions. They are easy to use and read. They are short and makes life easier at all! 

!!!WE HAVEN'T BEEN BUILDING THE WEBSITE IN A CERTAIN WAY THAT WORKS GOOD AND INTERACTS WITH USER! SO FAR WE ONLY USED THE PAGE FOR EXAMPLES ON CONSOLE!!!
